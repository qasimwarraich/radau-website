    <p>
        <br />
        Our concept is simple: we have the tools, you have the hands, and if you
        need help, we will try our best. We also have a collection of new and used
        parts. Everything works over donations (prix libre/kollekte), so please give
        as much as possible for you.
        <br /> <br />

        Outside of the workshop, we also want to offer a non capitalistic space
        for people to socialise and do projects without any expectations of
        consumption or any sense of exclusivity.

        <br /> <br />

        We are also known for organising alleycats, parties, concerts, and more.
