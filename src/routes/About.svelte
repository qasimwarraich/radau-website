        RAD.AU is your neighbourhood bicycle workshop collective and open space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our concept is simple: we have the tools, you have the hands, and if you
        need help, we will try our best. We also have a collection of new and
        used parts. Everything works over donations (prix libre/kollekte), so
        please give as much as possible for you.
        <br /> <br />

        We are also known for organising alleycats, parties, concerts, and more.
